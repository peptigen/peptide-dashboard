    "title": "Hemolytic Prediction",
    "details": "Recurrent (bi-LSTM) neural network for predicting if a peptide is hemolytic. Developed by Andrew White using data from The Database of Antimicrobial Activity and Structure of Peptides (DBAASP). The activity cutoff from dose response curves is 25 micrograms / ml. A positive prediction means the peptide is predicted to have hemolytic activity below that cutoff.",
    "use": "Peptides between 2 and 190 residues. L-chirality and canonical  amino acids",
    "factors": "Dataset was from sequences thought to be antimicrobial or clinically relevant",
    "metrics": "Test accuracy 0.90. Test AUC 0.81",
    "evaluation": "Withheld positive and negative examples",
    "training": "9316 positive and negative sequences. Only L chirality and canonical amino acids were trained.",
    "caveats": "The sequences tested were typically from biological sources.",
    "ethics": "These predictions are not a substitute for labratory experiments."
