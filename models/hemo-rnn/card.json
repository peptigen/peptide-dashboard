    "title": "Hemolytic Prediction",
    "details": "Recurrent (bi-LSTM) neural network for predicting if a peptide is hemolytic. Developed by Andrew White using data from The Database of Antimicrobial Activity and Structure of Peptides (DBAASP). The activity is defined from dose response curves point at which 50% of RBCs are lysed. If activity is below 25 Î¼g / ml, it is hemolytic.",
    "use": "Peptides between 2 and 190 residues. L-chirality and canonical  amino acids",
    "factors": "Dataset was from sequences thought to be antimicrobial or clinically relevant",
    "metrics": "Test accuracy 0.90. Test AUC 0.81",
    "evaluation": "Withheld positive and negative examples",
    "training": "9316 positive and negative sequences. Only L chirality and canonical amino acids were trained.",
    "caveats": "The sequences tested were typically from biological sources.",
    "ethics": "These predictions are not a substitute for labratory experiments."
