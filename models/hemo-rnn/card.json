{"title": "Hemolytic Prediction", "details": "Recurrent (GRU) neural network for predicting if a peptide is hemolytic. Developed by Andrew White using data from antimicrobial peptide database.Negative examples are insoluble peptides, antifouling peptides, and scrambled positives. Sample weights were used to remove negative example dataset sizes.", "use": "Peptides between 2 and 100 residues", "factors": "Dataset was from sequences thought to be antimicrobial", "metrics": "Test accuracy 1.00. Test AUC 0.97", "evaluation": "Withheld positive and negative examples", "training": "13902 positive and negative sequences", "caveats": "The sequences tested were typically from biologic sources and were chosen because they are thought to be antimicrobial. The dataset is small.The negative examples have insoluble peptides overrepresented so that the accuracy may be inflated if only comparing soluble peptides.", "ethics": "These predictions are not a substitute for labratory experiments."}
