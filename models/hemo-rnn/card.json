{"title": "Hemolytic Prediction", "details": "Recurrent (GRU) neural network for predicting if a peptide is hemolytic. Developed by Andrew White using data from antimicrobial peptide database.", "use": "Peptides between 2 and 100 residues", "factors": "Dataset was from sequences thought to be antimicrobial", "metrics": "Test accuracy 0.73", "evaluation": "Withheld positive and negative examples", "training": "634 positive and negative sequences", "caveats": "The sequences tested were typically from biologic sources and were chosen because they are thought to be antimicrobial. The dataset is small", "ethics": "These predictions are not a substitute for labratory experiments."}
