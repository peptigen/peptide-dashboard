{"title": "Solubility Prediction", "details": "Recurrent (GRU) neural network for predicting solubility. Developed by Andrew White using data from PROSO II database in TFJS.", "use": "Peptides or proteins expressed in E. coli that are less than 200 residues long. May provide solubility predictions more broadly applicable.", "factors": "Solubility was defined in PROSO II as sequence that was transfectible, expressible, secretable, separable, and soluble in E. coli system.", "metrics": "Test accuracy 0.66", "evaluation": "Withheld positive and negative examples", "training": "923 positive and negative sequences", "caveats": "This data is mostly long sequences and so may not be as applicable to solid-phase synthesized peptides.", "ethics": "None noted"}
